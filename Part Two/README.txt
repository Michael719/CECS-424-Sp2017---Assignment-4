(Quite the title eh?)
Immerse yourself into your daily routine of waking up late every morning of college!
Experience the rush of getting to school before that important test that will determine YOUR WHOLE LIFE.
Programmed with Prolog, this game features:
    A LOCKED DOOR: Figuratively speaking, I mean it is your parents house, you have the keys but alas your 
                   social life would deteriorate quickly if they found you outside walking around without any shoes.
    A HIDDEN OBJECT: You know those times where your monster of a little sister hides everything you need exactly before
                     you need it? Yup. We have that in the game. Good luck finding your backpack.
    AN INCOMPLETE OBJECT: Oddly enough, it would make even less sense for you to be seen walking outside with only one shoe 
                          on, than to be seen with no shoes on. It completely eliminates your excuse of "becoming one with nature".
                          (Which many would actually understand).
    LIMITED RESOURCE: A backpack is a resource right? And you only have one right? You have more than one? Oh well, you're playing my game
                      and in this game you only have one! mwahaha! Anyway, due to it being the hidden win condition I will consider it as the limited resource.
                      (I'm going to be honest, I wanted to implement a real life timer using timestamps or a turn system that decrimented
                      every room change until 0, but could not figure it out. And my scalp hurts already from all the headscratching I've
                      done to get this far).

Thanks for playing! ENJOY!
